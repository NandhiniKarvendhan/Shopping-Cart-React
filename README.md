# Shopping-Cart

This project creates a simple shopping cart. The shopping cart component contains two sections:

- **Product Lists:** This is a list of the available products that can be added to your cart. Products are displayed as buttons.
- **Shopping Cart:** This is a list of products that have been added to the cart.

Users can click any product in the Product list, and if that product is in stock, it will be added to the Shopping cart.
